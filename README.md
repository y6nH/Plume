# Plume [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Plume-org/Plume.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Plume-org/Plume)

Federated blogging engine, based on ActivityPub. It uses the Rocket framework, and Diesel to interact with the database.

[**Demo instance**](https://baptiste.gelez.xyz/)

It is not yet ready for production use, but we have all the basic features (account management, blogs, articles, comments, etc) and a basic federation.

Feel free to join our Matrix room: `#plume:disroot.org` to discuss about the project!

If you are interested in coding, check out the [development guide](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md). You can also help by reporting issues, suggesting features, or writing documentation for instance.

If you would like to help by translating Plume, we also have [a guide for you](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume/blob/master/INTERNATIONALIZATION.md)!
